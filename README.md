## General Tips
1. Make simple functions that only do 1 thing
2. Make a branch for each feature
3. Commit often (don't commit 100 files)
4. Write good commit messages
5. Try not to work on the same file

## How to Actually Work
1. Create/Delete/Change files
2. "Add"/"Stage" ONLY the changes that you want
3. "Commit" changes with a decriptive message (This is like a personal checkpoint. Try to commit often)

When you are ready to push your changes to GitHub:
1. "..."/"Pull, Push"/"Pull from.."/"main" (Maybe try and do this often)
2. Create Pull Request from your branch to main
3. ????
